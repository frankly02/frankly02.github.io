                            Volleyball is a sport that I picked up fairly recently. It was always a sport I was interested in, but never got the chance
                             to try. After the encouragement of one of my close friends, I decided to give it a try and found myself enamored with the sport. 
                             With the current COVID epidemic, I have had few chances to play; regardless, I look forward to every opportunity I get to play.

                            I've always enjoyed reading from a young age. While I find every genre interesting in some way, I tend to prefer fantasy novels, as 
                            their imaginative worlds are always fascinating to explore and picture in my mind.

                            I grew up playing video games as my main source of entertainment. To this day, though the games I play have changed, I still find 
                            video games as fun as I always have. In hindsight, my passion for video games may have sparked my interest in programming in the first place.

                                I served as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets for 5 years. The program itself was rather challenging, as some of the responsibilities
                                to be carried out as a Cadet were mundane and excrutiating at times. At the same time, there were many aspects of the program that were
                                incredibly fun, namely making friends with other fellow cadets. Overall, I think fondly of my time at Cadets, as I made many happy memories there,
                                and learned a lot about myself while I served as a cadet.

                                I participated in the Worlds Scholars Cup (WSC) as a member of the club in high school. The WSC is an annual multi-round competition with a variety
                                of subjects to compete as teams of three. It features three rounds: regional rounds in individual cities, global rounds that encompass qualified competitors from 
                                regional rounds all around the world, and a final round at Yale University. Some subjects it touches on include: Debate, Literature, Science, and 
                                Social Studies.

                                In the two years I was a member of the club, I attended a regional round in Toronto, and a global round in Manila, Philippines. The competition itself
                                was incredibly fun, as the topics chosen for the competition were all very interesting to discuss with my teammates. Regardless of the outcome of
                                the competition, I would always be able to have fun trying my best with my peers. I especially had fun during the global round in Manila I participated
                                in, as I got to both travel with my friends and compete against other students from different countries; something I thought I would never have an 
                                opportunity to experience. Overall, World Scholars Cup was an exciting experience in my life, and is something I wish I could continue participating in.
